                       <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
              <span>D</span>                     <span>Em</span>
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      <span>C</span>                        <span>G</span>
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              <span>D</span>                        <span>Em</span>
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go


<span class="">Em</span> <span class="">C</span> <span>D</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Em</span> <span>C</span> <span class="">D</span>


<span>Em</span>                            <span>C</span>
Staring at the bottom of your glass
       <span>D</span>                           <span>Bm</span>
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
                <span>Em</span>               <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
    <span>Em</span>                          <span>C</span>
You see her when you close your eyes
      <span>D</span>                         <span>Bm</span>
Maybe one day you'll understand why
               <span>Em</span>                <span>C</span>   <span>D</span>
Everything you touch, oh it dies


                      <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
But you only need the light when it's burning low
              <span>D</span>                     <span>Em</span>
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      <span>C</span>                        <span>G</span>
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              <span>D</span>                        <span>Em</span>
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go


<span>Em</span>                            <span>C</span>
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
         <span>D</span>                     <span>Bm</span>
Same old empty feeling in your heart
                  <span>Em</span>               <span>C</span>          <span>D</span>
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         <span>Em</span>                     <span>C</span>
Well you see her when you fall asleep
             <span>D</span>                  <span>Bm</span>
But never to touch and never to keep
                         <span>Em</span>                 <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>
'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep


                       <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
              <span>D</span>                     <span>Em</span>
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      <span>C</span>                        <span>G</span>
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              <span>D</span>                        <span>Em</span>
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go



And you let her go
<span>Em</span>  <span>C</span>    <span>D</span>
Oh oh oh no

And you let her go
<span>Em</span>  <span>C</span>    <span class="">D</span>
Oh oh oh no

Well you let her go

<span>Em</span> <span>C</span> <span>D</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>EM</span> <span>C</span> <span>D</span>

                         <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              <span class="">D</span>                        <span>Em</span>
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go


                         <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              <span>D</span>                     <span>Em</span>
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      <span>C</span>                        <span>G</span>
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              <span>D</span>                        <span>Em</span>
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Only know you love her when you let her go
                     (Em)
And you let her go
