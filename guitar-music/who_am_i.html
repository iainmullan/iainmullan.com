<span>G</span>        <span>C</span>     <span>Am</span>

<span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>
Hold me up to the light
               <span>Am</span>
Tell me if the sun comes shining through
   <span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>
And I've got this heaviness in my chest
          <span>Am</span>
Since your love came breaking through

   <span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>
And I wanna know where it's coming from
              <span>Am</span>
Where is this coming from?

Where is this coming from?
   <span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>
And I wanna know what you're running from
             <span>C</span>
What are you running from?


      <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
        <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?
      <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
        <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?


<span>G</span>                  <span>C</span>
Lay my dreams down at your feet
      <span>Am</span>
Baby, watch out where you step
<span>G</span>              <span>C</span>
And there's no need for us
        <span>Am</span>
Knowing all the answers yet


   <span>G</span>                       <span>C</span>
And I wanna know what you're running from
             <span>Am</span>
What are you running from?

What are you running from?
   <span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>
And I wanna know where it's coming from
              <span>Am</span>
Where is this coming from?


      <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
        <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?
      <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
        <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?


<span>C</span>                                   <span>D</span>
You're back for a minute and you're gone
        <span>G</span>         <span>C</span>
And I'll never know how close I came
<span>C</span>                                   <span>D</span>
You're back for a minute and you're gone
        <span>G</span>             <span>C</span>
And I'll never know how close
<span>C</span>                                   <span>D</span>
You're back for a minute and you're gone
         <span>G</span>
And I'll never know how



<span>G</span>       <span>C</span>     <span>Am</span>


      <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
        <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?

      <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
       <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?
      <span>G</span>       <span>C</span>
Who am I, who am I
        <span>Am</span>
Without you, without you?
       <span>G</span>
Who am I?
